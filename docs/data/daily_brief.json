      "title": "AgentArk: Distilling Multi-Agent Intelligence into a Single LLM Agent",
      "summary": "arXiv:2602.03955v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: While large language model (LLM) multi-agent systems achieve superior reasoning performance through iterative debate, practical deployment is limited by their high computational cost and error propagation. This paper proposes AgentArk, a novel framework to distill multi-agent dynamics into the weights",
      "technical_takeaway": "Agent orchestration is emerging as a new software abstraction layer.",

      "title": "Rethinking imitation learning with Predictive Inverse Dynamics Models",
      "summary": "This research looks at why Predictive Inverse Dynamics Models often outperform standard Behavior Cloning in imitation learning. By using simple predictions of what happens next, PIDMs reduce ambiguity and learn from far fewer demonstrations. The post Rethinking imitation learning with Predictive Inverse Dynamics Models appeared first on Microsoft R",

      "summary": "ICE has used Mobile Fortify to identify immigrants and citizens alike over 100,000 times, by one estimate. It wasn't built to work like that—and only got approved after DHS abandoned its own privacy rules.",
      "technical_takeaway": "Trust, not model size, is becoming a core technical constraint in AI systems.",
