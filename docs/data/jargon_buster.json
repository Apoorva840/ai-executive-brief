            "term": "Agentic AI",
            "definition": "Agentic AI refers to AI systems designed to act autonomously, make decisions, and pursue goals over time, often by breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps, planning, executing actions, and learning from feedback. Unlike simpler AI that just responds to a single prompt, an agentic AI can proactively work towards a multi-step objective.",
            "analogy": "Imagine you have a smart kitchen robot. A simple AI might just follow one recipe step-by-step. An 'Agentic AI' kitchen robot, however, could be given a goal like 'prepare a healthy dinner for four people by 7 PM.' It would then autonomously choose a recipe, check the pantry for ingredients, add missing items to a shopping list, order groceries, preheat the oven, cook the meal, and even clean up, adapting its plan if, for example, a delivery is delayed. It plans, acts, and learns towards a goal, managing the whole process."

            "term": "Hallucination (in LLMs)",
            "definition": "In Large Language Models (LLMs), 'hallucination' refers to the phenomenon where the AI generates information that sounds plausible and confident but is actually false, nonsensical, or not supported by its training data or the context it was given. It's like the AI 'making things up' with conviction.",
            "analogy": "Think of your car's advanced navigation system. If it 'hallucinates,' it might confidently tell you to turn left onto a road that doesn't exist, or claim a bridge is open when it's actually been under construction for months. It presents this incorrect information with the same certainty as accurate directions, potentially leading you far off course."

            "term": "Digital Twin",
            "definition": "A digital twin is a virtual, real-time replica of a physical object, system, or process. It's built using data from sensors on its physical counterpart, allowing continuous monitoring, simulation, analysis, and prediction of its behavior without directly interacting with the real thing. Changes or issues observed in the physical item are reflected in its digital twin.",
            "analogy": "Imagine you have a high-performance racing car, and for every real component in that car, there's an exact virtual copy running simultaneously in a computer simulation. This 'digital twin' receives all the live data from sensors on the actual car \u2013 speed, engine temperature, tire pressure, fuel level. Engineers can use this digital twin to test new settings, predict how the car will perform under different track conditions, or diagnose potential mechanical issues before they even happen in the real race, all without putting the actual car at risk."
