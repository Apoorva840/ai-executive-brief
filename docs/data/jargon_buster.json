            "term": "Generative AI",
            "definition": "A type of artificial intelligence that can create new, original content like text, images, music, or videos, rather than just analyzing existing data. It learns from vast amounts of existing information to understand patterns and then uses that understanding to generate something entirely new and unique.",
            "analogy": "Imagine a super-smart chef (Generative AI) who has studied thousands of recipes and cooking techniques. Instead of just following a recipe to make an existing dish, this chef can invent entirely new dishes, complete with new flavors, textures, and presentations, based on everything they've learned about cooking. They don't copy; they create."

        {
            "term": "Deepfakes",
            "definition": "Deepfakes are synthetic media (like images, audio, or video) that have been manipulated or generated by AI to replace one person's likeness with another's, or to make someone say or do things they never did. They are incredibly realistic, often making it very hard to tell what's real and what's fake.",
            "analogy": "Think of a car customization shop with advanced robotics (Deepfake AI). Instead of just painting your car a new color, this shop can use its tools to perfectly replace your car's exterior with that of a luxury sports car, making it look exactly like the real thing, down to the smallest detail, even though it's still your original car underneath. It creates a convincing, but fake, appearance."

        {
            "term": "Autonomous AI",
            "definition": "Refers to AI systems that can operate and make decisions on their own, without constant human oversight or intervention. They are designed to perceive their environment, understand situations, and take actions to achieve a goal, like navigating a car or identifying targets, based on their programming.",
            "analogy": "Imagine a self-driving car (Autonomous AI) that doesn't just assist you but can plan its entire route, navigate through traffic, park itself, and react to unexpected obstacles all on its own, without you touching the steering wheel or pedals. It perceives the road, understands the rules, and makes all the driving decisions independently."
