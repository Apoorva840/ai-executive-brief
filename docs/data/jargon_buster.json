            "term": "Large Language Model (LLM)",
            "definition": "A powerful type of artificial intelligence designed to understand, generate, and process human-like text. It's trained on vast amounts of text data to learn patterns, grammar, facts, and even some reasoning, allowing it to perform tasks like answering questions, writing essays, summarizing information, and translating languages.",
            "analogy": "Think of an LLM as a super-advanced **recipe book and chef all rolled into one**. It has 'read' billions of recipes (text data) from every cuisine imaginable, so it knows all the ingredients (words), cooking techniques (grammar and logic), and dish variations (different topics). When you ask it to 'make a birthday cake' (a text prompt), it doesn't just look up one recipe; it intelligently combines its vast knowledge to generate a unique, coherent, and often delicious (well-written) response, adapting to your specific requests and even suggesting variations. It doesn't truly taste the food, but it knows how to put the right things together based on what it's learned."

        {
            "term": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)",
            "definition": "A technique used to improve the accuracy and relevance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by giving them access to external, up-to-date, or specific information sources. Instead of solely relying on its pre-trained knowledge, an LLM using RAG first 'looks up' relevant information from a separate database or set of documents, and then uses that retrieved information to formulate its answer. This helps prevent the LLM from 'making things up' (hallucinating) and provides more factual, grounded responses.",
            "analogy": "Imagine your super-chef LLM is preparing a complex meal. While it has a vast general knowledge of cooking, sometimes you need very specific, real-time information \u2013 like 'What's the best way to prepare this particular rare exotic fruit I just bought?' or 'What are the latest health regulations for food storage in this specific region?'. **RAG is like giving your chef an instant-access, continually updated, specific culinary encyclopedia, a direct line to a specialist ingredient supplier, or a real-time regulatory database.** Before answering your question, the chef quickly consults these external, reliable sources, retrieves the exact relevant details, and then uses that fresh, accurate information to prepare the dish perfectly, rather than just guessing based on its general training."

            "term": "AI Agent",
            "definition": "An AI agent is an autonomous system, often powered by an LLM, that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and perform actions to achieve specific goals. Unlike a simple chatbot that just responds to prompts, an agent can break down complex tasks, use tools (like web search, code interpreters, or external APIs), remember past interactions, and adapt its behavior to work towards a predefined objective over multiple steps.",
            "analogy": "Think of a modern **self-driving car** as an AI agent. It 'perceives its environment' through sensors (cameras, radar, lidar). It 'makes decisions' (turns left, brakes, accelerates) based on its programming and current sensor data. It 'performs actions' (controls steering, pedals, signals). Its 'goal' is to safely get you from point A to point B. It can 'break down complex tasks' (driving from start to finish involves many sub-tasks like lane keeping, navigation, parking). It 'uses tools' (GPS for navigation, its own internal maps, communication systems). It 'remembers past interactions' (like the current traffic situation or previous route choices, even short-term observations). It 'adapts its behavior' (slows down in rain, avoids obstacles, changes routes for traffic). It's not just following one command; it's actively working towards an objective, dynamically adjusting along the way."
