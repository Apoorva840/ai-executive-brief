    "summary": "arXiv:2602.03955v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: While large language model (LLM) multi-agent systems achieve superior reasoning performance through iterative debate, practical deployment is limited by their high computational cost and error propagation. This paper proposes AgentArk, a novel framework to distill multi-agent dynamics into the weights",

    "summary": "This research looks at why Predictive Inverse Dynamics Models often outperform standard Behavior Cloning in imitation learning. By using simple predictions of what happens next, PIDMs reduce ambiguity and learn from far fewer demonstrations. The post Rethinking imitation learning with Predictive Inverse Dynamics Models appeared first on Microsoft R",
