Rather than encoding all procedural knowledge within model weights, agent skills -- composable packages of instructions, code,",

Existing detectors depend on impractical assumptions, such as white-box settings, or solely rely on text-level features, leading to imprecise detection ability. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective and pra",
